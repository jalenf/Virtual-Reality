My project was made in A-frame using the inpector tool, sourced and custom models, and A-frames built in tools.

The project focused on how Covid has impacted me. One example is here with the guitar. I started to learn some guitar over quarantine to pass the time.

I created 5 custom models as well for this project a few of them can be seen here such as the flower pot and couch.

Here is the bathroom. There is no toliet paper becuase during quarantine it was impossible to find.

This is where I spent most of my time over quarantine. I usualy was on my computer doing school work or playing video games. The skateboard also represents another hobby I aquired over quarantine.
